Today I would like to give you an overview about how we automated tests in my project and to explain a bit what Cucumber Framework is. Writing these slides, I realised that we can&#8217;t explain Cucumber without first have some context about the reasons to create that framework.

So first of all, you&#8217;ll see a bit of theory about Behavior-Driver development process, then I&#8217;m going to introduce you to the Gherkin syntax and Cucumber framework.
