During the lockdown, here in Spain, I deciced to to start a skeleton of a Cucumber Test Framework, so I can use it in future projects. It is based in the TechStack we are currently using in the [Uyuni project](https://www.uyuni-project.org/), where I contribute.


This is a [Cucumber project skeleton](https://github.com/srbarrios/cucumber-ruby-skeleton) written in Ruby, using Capybara framework to interact with a website. It also include CI powered by GitHub Actions.
